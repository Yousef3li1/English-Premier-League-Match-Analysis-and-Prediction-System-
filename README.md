# 🏆 English Premier League Match Analysis and Prediction System 🏆



---

## 📋 **Project Overview**
This project explores the match day statistics of the **2021-2022 English Premier League season** and applies **Machine Learning (Naive Bayes)** to predict match outcomes. With an in-depth analysis of teams, goals, and referees, the project delivers valuable insights for football enthusiasts, analysts, and sports betting systems.

The system is backed by interactive data dashboards, CSV data processing, and predictive models to enhance understanding and forecasting of game results.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model  

We implemented the **Naive Bayes classifier**, a probabilistic machine learning model, to predict match outcomes (Home win, Away win, Draw). The following steps were followed:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing data  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Feature scaling  

2. **Model Training and Evaluation**  
   - Training the Naive Bayes model on match statistics  
   - Testing its performance
